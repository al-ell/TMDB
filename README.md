## User Experience

### Project Goals

Children's safety on the internet is a current concern as adult content is rarely filtered out. I want to create a website that will filter out any innapropriate content. I will create a space children to safely choose family friendly films.

### User Stories

#### __Target Audience__

The target audience for the website are children (and their families) with access to streaming services at home.

#### __First Time Visitor Goals__

As a first time user of the site I want to:

- Browse new and popular films
- Browse diffferent film catagories
- Search for a specific film
- Know how highly rated a film is
- See for a summary about the film

#### __Returning Visitor Goals__

As a Returning visitor I want to:

- All first time user goals  
- See what's new since I last looked for a film to watch

#### __Admin User__

As an administrator for the site I want to:

- Provide a safe website for children to choose films
- Show clear and easy to follow information to allow independent use
- Maintain the API connection to allow full functionality
- Be able to update the features with ease

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![color scheme](/assets/documentation/styling/color-pallete.png)
careated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color pallete generator.

I have chosen the red, yellow and green to represent the films ratings. They will colour code the movie cards.

### Typography

I have chosen child friendly Google Fonts for the logo, headings/movie titles and paragraphs.

## Features

The website is comprised of 2 pages:

- Index page
- Contact form page
  
### Elements found on each page

- Navbar/Burger icon
- Search bar
- Genre buttons

### Future Implementations

Possible future updates can include:

- Create an account
- See a list of my "to watch"/favourite films
- Watch the trailer
- See where I can stream the films online
- Filter films by different age groups/parental lock feature

### Accessibility

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript.

### Frameworks Used

- [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

### Libraries & Packages Used

[Codeanywhere] - Online code editor.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to create wireframes.

[Github](https://github.com/) - To save and store the files for the website.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To import the fonts used on the website.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  - For the icons on the website.

### Programs Used

### API

[The Movies DB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)
is used throughout the project to gain information displayed to the website user.

[To find the genre codes](<https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/genre-movie-list>)
This allowd me to find the correct genre number to filter family films.

[TMDB advanced filtering](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/discover-movie) -
Allows experiments with genre, classification and language options for homepage results.

[To filter search results](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-movie)

## Credits

### Code Used

The initial tutorial/walkthrough I followed to get the Movies API working are videos 52 - 55 (transcribed - no source code used): [50 Projects In 50 Days HTML, CSS & Java Script](https://archive.org/details/50-projects-in-50-days-html-css-java-script_202207/18+Day+17+-+Movie+App/053+Project+Intro.mp4). I worked on this project in Visual Studio Code which I saved locally. I have pasted in and credited any code copied into this project.

An updated genre url: [Finding genres](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/deserialization-on-tmdb-api). Prior to finding this way of filtering genre ids I was getting some results that were not family films.

TMDB API forum discussion : [How to make a http request to show the genres of a specific movie](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/56183386c3a3682441000486)
