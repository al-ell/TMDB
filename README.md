## User Experience

### Project Goals

Children's safety on the internet is a current concern as adult content is rarely filtered out. I want to create a website that will filter out any innapropriate content. I will create a space children to safely choose family friendly films.

### User Stories

#### __Target Audience__

The target audience for the website are children (and their families) with access to streaming services at home.

#### __First Time Visitor Goals__

As a first time user of the site I want to:

- Browse new and popular films
- Browse diffferent film catagories
- Search for a specific film
- Know how highly rated a film is
- See for a summary about the film

#### __Returning Visitor Goals__

As a Returning visitor I want to:

- All first time user goals  
- See what's new since I last looked for a film to watch

#### __Admin User__

As an administrator for the site I want to:

- Provide a safe website for children to choose films
- Show clear and easy to follow information to allow independent use
- Maintain the API connection to allow full functionality
- Be able to update the features with ease

#### __Future Releases__

##### Users

- Create an account
- See a list of my "to watch"/favourite films
- Watch the trailer
- See where I can stream the films online
- Filter films by different age groups/parental lock feature

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![color scheme](/assets/documentation/styling/color-pallete.png)
careated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color pallete generator.

I have chosen the red, yellow and green to represent the films ratings. They will colour code the movie cards.

### Typography

I have chosen child friendly Google Fonts for the logo, headings/movie titles and paragraphs.
